The IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) See Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits.\""}

The error can occur on the MQ server or also a MQ client application.. AMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed for channel '???'. EXPLANATION: WebSphere MQ failed to determine the revocation status of the remote SSL certificate for one of the following reasons: (a) The channel was unable to contact any of the CRL servers or OCSP responders for the certificate. (b) None of the OCSP responders contacted knows the revocation status of the certificate. (c) An OCSP response was received, but the digital signature of the response could not be verified.", "output": "With the release of WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.0 the use of OCSP certificate revocation checking was included. With this new feature, most likely your SSL certificates have a OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) certificate extension embedded inside them. This was ignored before V7.0.1.0. Now it is being used to verify the certificate. The most likely cause of the failure is that the system can not access the servers listed in the AIA. This then returns a UNKNOWN status when the check is done. The default action for MQ is to not allow the channel to start and the AMQ9716 to be reported when the UNKNOWN is returned."}

What factors are involved that I need watch out for?", "output": "When tuning WebSphere Portal at version 6.0 and beyond, one of the concerns that arises is how should one tune the maximum number of Portal datasources. Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. Each Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. However, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1"}

In other words, prevent authenticating to Portal as \"user1\" from one browser and then simultaneously authenticating to Portal again as \"user1\" from another browser?", "output": "WebSphere Portal has no built-in mechanism or configuration setting to limit the number of times a user id may log in. Unexpected behavior may occur if the same id is logged in more than once and this is not supported. \"ConcurrentModificationException\" and other errors may be logged. Most of the related issues were resolved in WebSphere Portal 5.1. However, you may still encounter exceptions or side-effects if you access the Portal in multiple browser windows using the same user id, whether or not the authentication requests take place on separate physical hosts. It may be possible to prevent multiple logins by writing custom \"tracking code.\" Contact IBM Services for assistance to undertake such a project. WebSphere Portal Development does not have any sample code. If you wish to write your own code, some of the issues to be aware of are (this is not an inclusive list): -- Multiple logins may take place on different nodes in a cluster. This means some cluster-wide mechanism would have to be in place to keep track of the logged-in users. Look at the WebSphere Application Server DistributedMap interface. -- There should be a fail-safe way to track user logout (explicit logout and session timeout). Using a session listener might be a possibility. -- If a user closes the browser without logging out, that user must wait for a session timeout before logging in again. Otherwise, there should be a \"force simultaneous login\" option in the login user interface. For load testing, use unique user ids or virtual users."}

When scanned perfectly at 200 DPI this would result in 4 pixels, and at 300 DPI 6 pixels. * For Code 39 symbols: a 20 mil X-dimension results in a density of approximately 3.6 characters per inch. Optimally the height should be at least 1/4 inch or 15% of the width, whichever is greater, though this is not an absolute requirement.

With any text editor, open the /nz/data/config/system.cfg file. 3. Look for a system.srcMode definition in the file to make sure that one is not already present and/or commented out. If you find an entry, make sure that system.srcMode=1 is set and not commented out with a # character. If you cannot find an entry, add system.srcMode=1 to the file. 4.
